	<h1>KHAYALI PULAO</h1>
	<img class="kp" src="photos/images.jpg">
    <p class="xx">In times when streaming platforms are obsessed with dark and gory content, how comforting would it be to watch a feel-good, light-hearted, uplifting film? With this thought, I began watching the short film Khayali Pulao on YouTube. And, it indeed is comforting.<br>

Asha (Prajakta Koli) is a class topper in a small village in Haryana. When we meet her, she is cooking her own ‘khayali pulao’ (daydreaming) until her sports coach Kharab Sir (Yashpal Sharma) announces he is forming a handball team for a match on Republic Day. Asha, who is good in academics, is determined to be a part of this team. Her teacher, coach, friend and mother are unable to fathom her sudden obsession with sports. However, the audience is told, it is not for her love for the sport, but its the uniform, a T-shirt and shorts, that entices her.</p>
